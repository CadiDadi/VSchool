% vs px - % makes it RESPONSIVE

CSS Positioning

CSS positioning is involved, but take the time to memorize and understand these challenging principles early and it will make your font end developing life a whole lot more pleasant.

The four positions we will talk about now are:

static
relative
fixed
absolute

In CSS, we would make an element a certain position like:

div {
  position: relative;
}
Or whatever position we need.

Static
Static is the default. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

Relative
Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.

This means we can give them top, bottom, left and right properties. We could not have done that to a static element.

This pushes the element away from the top, bottom, left or right.

div {
    position: relative;
    top: 60px;
}
This would push or div down (away from the top) 60px.

Make sure you have these two positions memorized, and understand them before moving on.

So, just regular position: relative does change where it's going to sit, but once we say: right: 10px it's going to move ten pixels from the right of where it would be if positioned statically.

Fixed
Fixed elements stay on the viewport (screen or window) where you put them no matter where you scroll.

Bottom, top, left and right are used to position them.

You can stick a footer permanently to the bottom of the page, even if you scroll, like this:

.footer-content {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
}

Absolute
These elements should be nested somewhere in a positioned element.

They look for their nearest positioned ancestor and can use top, bottom, left and right to be positioned exactly inside that positioned ancestor.

Positioned and not Positioned
Every element with the position static is considered "not positioned." Every element with the positions fixed, relative, or absolute are considered "positioned." This is important for position Absolute.

Tutorials and Practice
Here are some useful tutorials to being able to understand these positions. It's important to practice using these. You can't avoid positioning.

width - why 98% (not 100%)? to compensate for margin, which takes 1% from left&right (and top&bottom) => width 98% + margin-left 1% + margin-right 1% = 100%

Design a blog

Create a website that contains the following:

A fixed horizontal navbar (meaning it is always on the top of the page, even if you scroll down)
A blog-style feed, where each blog post (which you'll just hard-code in for now) is in the center of the page, and as your scroll down the page it shows older blog posts.
Each blog post should have a title of some kind
Each blog post should have the date it was "published"
Each blog post should have a photo of some kind near the top of the text, and the text should wrap around the photo and have a reasonable margin between the photo and the wrapped text.
The blog posts' content can just be hard-coded, meaning it'll all just be on a single page and you can just put filler text (lorem ipsum) there if you want. */
